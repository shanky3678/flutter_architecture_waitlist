# Architecture: I face this issue every time I begin a new flutter project.

Whenever I start a new project I have to think about what kind of architecture to use, and setup navigation routes for mobile and web.
After the update of Navigator 2.0, it was hard to understand and set it up. It was a pain for a beginner like me. Also, the community was small to help me out with this.

Hence I'm building a solution for these issues so that every time we start a new project, we don't have to waste time writing lines and lines of code just to setup architecture (Just making life easier). 

This solution will:
- Kickstart your project by building an architecture for you
- Automatically set up Navigations for different pages (you can specify these pages or can be imported from Figma)
- Automatically sets up responsive screens 
- SSetup Firebase login services
 
I want to share this with you guys when it's completed. Let me know if you want this.
